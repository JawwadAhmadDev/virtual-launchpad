# What is TGE?

# What is Presale?
A Presale is a practice where assets are made available for purchase to selected customers before an advertised selling date. In most cases, Presale involves investments from private companies on products that are still under development. This is also a way for companies to accumulate money that they can use in funding the project.

# What is soft cap & Hard Cap?
A Soft Cap is a minimum amount of collected investment that is sufficient for considering the ICO or STO a success. I.e. a soft cap of $1M means that if we raise $999,999, our fundraising campaign has failed. A Hard Cap in its turn is a maximum amount of investment that the project is ready to accept.
